# SnowCrash

This project is a hands-on introduction to cybersecurity, designed to challenge and develop your skills through a series of progressively complex levels. Each level requires you to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a controlled environment, ultimately preparing you to safeguard real-world software from similar threats. The project emphasizes critical thinking, problem-solving, and the practical application of security principles.
