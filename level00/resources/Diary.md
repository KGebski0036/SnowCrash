Our initial approach was to search for files containing the words "level00" or "flag00," but this led to a dead end.

Next, we shifted our focus and searched for files owned by our user, which brought us closer to the solution:

```bash
find / -user flag00 2>/dev/null
/usr/sbin/john
/rofs/usr/sbin/john
```

Upon examining these files, we discovered a strange string: `cdiiddwpgswtgt`. Initially, we thought it might be a password, but it wasnâ€™t. We then ran the string through a Caesar cipher decoder and found that the correct decoding shift was `41` not the expected `42`. ðŸ˜”

The final password is `nottoohardhere`.
